# The Kronorium
Making your easter egg life easier
This project is in a very early stage of life.

Quick preview of the idea:

# Contributing
The project is built using Flutter and will currently target only flutter web for actual releases. However, building
in Windows and Linux is supported for better developer iteration.

## Issues
  * I'm trying to maintain a relatively updated backlog of issues
  * If you have a suggestion, please open a new issue with the best level of detail that you can provide
  * As always, pull requests are greatly appreciated
## Easter Egg JSONs
  * The guides are defined as json files stored in [easter_eggs/](easter_eggs/).
  * In the current prototyping phase of the project, all the guides are incomplete and are mainly
    just placeholders for previewing the app. They were generated using ChatGPT and are currently incorrect.
  * If you are not a developer, but would like to help. Making improvements to the current guides and/or creating guides
    for missing maps is **HUGELY** appreciated.
  * Moon is the "kinda" most updated guide
## Tips:
[This repository](https://github.com/shiversoftdev/t7-source) contains decompiled sources for the scripts of Black Ops 1.
It can be used for validating guides and actual easter egg behaviours.
